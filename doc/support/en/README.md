# Chartuner

## What does this do?

It simply receives a string and lets you create the bold or italic representation of the string characteres using the Unicode mathematics symbols so that `ABC` is converted to`𝐀𝐁𝐂` or `𝐴𝐵𝐶`.  

## And that's all?

Yes.

## Really?

Yes.

## Any additional consideration for such a "useful" tool?

Take into account that the generated text will be human-readable but not appropiately read by accesibility tools or text indexing tools. Use this tool wisefully.
